    "As dicussed in [Command Line Basics](command_line_part1.ipynb), there are actually several programs available that allow users to interact with their operating system via text commands instead of using their mouse to click on icons. On this site, we'll focus on learning `bash`, because it's so ubiquitous in the data science space. Why? Mostly because it is the default command line tool for Linux operating systems, and while you may not know it, *most* of the computers you interact with on a daily basis run Linux. Your personal computer may be a mac (which also uses `bash` by default) or a windows computer, but the computers that run nearly every website you visit, manage your email, run those ticket kiosk you see at the airport, etc. are almost all running on Linux. Moreover, if your data science career ever requires you to use computers in the cloud (amazon cloud services, or just an extra powerful server you company or university has for really serious computational work), it will run Linux. So there's a lot of good reasons to learn `bash`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**But**: `bash` is not the default on windows, so on this page, I'll show you how to set up a system that lets you work with `bash` on your windows computer. Note that because `bash` is not the default windows tool, there will be a few little wrinkles in how this is done, and it will never work quite as seamlessly as the default windows command line tools (`PowerShell` and `CMD`). \n",
    "\n",
    "**If you are a passionate windows user or someone who plans to only use windows, you are probably better off learning to use the default windows command line tools!**"

    "\n",
    "To get a good bash interface in windows, we just need to [install Git for Windows by going here and running the installer](https://gitforwindows.org/). This also has the benefit of installing `git`, which we discuss [elsewhere on this site](git_and_github.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once installed, you'll have a new program called `git bash` -- this is a `bash` interface in windows! Yay!!! Now you can go forth with the tutorials. There will be a few little idiosyncracies that come up because of how it integrates bash into windows, but on the whole it works really well."
