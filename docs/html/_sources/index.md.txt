Welcome to Course Site for Practical Data Science!
==================================================

**Warning: This site is a work in progress!**

Data Science is an intrinsically applied field, and yet all too often students are taught the advanced math and statistics behind data science tools, but are left to fend for themselves when it comes to learning the tools we use to do data science on a day-to-day basis or how to manage actual projects. This course is designed to fill that gap.

This course will be divided into two parts:

- **Part 1: Data Wrangling**: In Part 1 of this course, students will develop hands-on experience manipulating real world data using a range of data science tools (including the command line, python, jupyter, git, and github).
- **Part 2: Answering Questions**: This course adopts the view that Data Science is the study of how best to **answer questions** about the world **using quantitative data**. In Part 2 of this course, students will learn to develop data science projects to answer meaningful questions via backwards design, and to manage projects from inception to presentation of results.

The first portion of the course will provide students with extensive hands-on experience manipulating real (often messy, error ridden, and poorly documented) data using the a range of bread-and-butter data science tools (like the command line, git, python (especially numpy and pandas), jupyter notebooks, and more). The goal of these exercises is to ensure students are comfortable working with data in most any form. In addition to being of intrinsic value, developing these skills will also ensure that in advanced statistics or machine learning courses, students can focus on understanding the concepts being taught rather than having to split their attention between concepts and the nuts and bolts of data manipulation required to complete assignments.

In the second portion of the class, we will take a step back from the nuts and bolts of data manipulation and talk about how to approach the central task of data science: answering questions about the world. In particular, we'll discuss how to use backwards design to plan data science projects, how to refine questions to ensure they are answerable, how to evaluate whether you've actually answered the question you set out to answer, and how to pick the **most appropriate** data science tool based on the question you seek to answer.
