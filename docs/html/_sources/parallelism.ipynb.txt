    "Before you dive into this, let me just tell you the punchline of this entire page right up front: parallelism is the **last tool** you want to turn to for speed. It is **not** a silver bullet, it will generally take you *significant* time to implement, the speed improvements from parallelism are generally **much** smaller than what you get from other performance improvement methods (see [Understanding Performance](performance_understanding.ipynb) and [Performance Solutions](performance_solutions.ipynb)), and the headaches of parallelizing code are many. \n",
