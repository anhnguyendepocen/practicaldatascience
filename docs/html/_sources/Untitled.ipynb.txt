    "## What is distributed computing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's being our discussion of distributed computing with an obvious question: what *is* distributed computing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributed computing is the practice of dividing up a computational problem into sub-problems, assigning those parts to different processing units, executing those sub-problems, and recombining the result of your subproblems into a single result. \n",
    "\n",
    "But wait, you say... isn't that exactly the definition you gave for \"parallelization\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yup! Distributed computing is just a form of parallelization. In general, though, what differentiates distributed computing from regular parallelization is that in distributed computing, we want to distribute our work *across many physical computers*, not just the various cores on a single machine. \n",
