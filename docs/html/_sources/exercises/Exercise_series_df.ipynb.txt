    "# Estimating Labor Market Returns to Education\n",

    "**Note:** Most students taking this class are Duke MIDS students who have worked with `pandas` previously. As a result, these exercises are very light on basic pandas Series and DataFrame manipulations. If you are new to `pandas`, I would advise looking into some addition practice opportunities with `pandas`, as discussed in the [Advice for Non-MIDS Students](../not_a_mids_student.ipynb) page. \n",

    "In this exercise, we're going to use data from the [American Communities Survey (ACS)](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/acs.shtml) to study the relationship betwen educational attainment and wages. The ACS is a survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau (though it is not \"The Census\", which is a counting of every person in the United States that takes place every 10 years) to measure numerous features of the US population. The data we will be working with includes about 100 variables from the 2017 ACS survey, and is composed of only 10% of all the people actually surveyed by the ACS. This data comes from [IPUMS](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/), which provides a very useful tool for getting subsets of major survey datasets, not just from the US, but [from government statistical agencies the world over](https://international.ipums.org/international-action/sample_details).\n",

    "Within this data is information on both the educational background and current earnings of a representative sample of Americans. We will now use this data to estimate the labor-market returns to graduating high school and college, and to learn something about the meaning of an educational degree. "

    "Congratulations! You just discovered \"the sheepskin effect!:\" people with degrees tend to earn more than people who have the same education, but don't have the certificate of completion. \n",
    "\n",
    "In economics, this is viewed as evidence that the reason employers pay people with high school degrees more than those without degree is that they think graduating high school demonstrates grit and determination, *not* because employers think high school graduates have learned specific, useful skills. After all, if employers were paying for specific skills, then someone who completes 10th grade should earn more than someone who only finished 9th, and someone who completed 11th grade should earn almost as much as someone who finished 12th grade. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finishing high school, in other words, isn't about accumulating specific knowledge; it's about showing that you *are the kind of person* who can rise to the challenge of finishing high school, also suggesting you are also the kind of person who can succeed as an employee. (Obviously, this data does not tell us whether that is an *accurate* inference, just that that seems to be how employeers think.) \n",
    "\n",
    "The high school degree, in other words, is a *signal* about the kind of person you are (an idea that earned [Michael Spence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Spence) a Nobel Prize in Economics). \n",
    "\n",
    "This is important not only because you've just done the analysis that gave rise to a Nobel Prize, but also because you've identified an empirical regularity with very important policy implications. For example, if you wanted to improve labor market outcomes in a community that has a high drop-out rate, this suggests that it's not enough to just try and keep students in high school a little bit longer -- you really need to try to push students to graduate high school if you want them to see significant wage benefits."
