Welcome to Data Science Nuts and Bolts!
=============================================

**Warning: This site is very much a work in progress!**

Data Science is an intrinsically applied field, and yet all too often students are taught the advanced math and statistics behind data science tools, but are left to fend for themselves when it comes to learning the tools we use to do data science on a day-to-day basis.

This site is designed to fill that gap by (a) providing readers the opportunity to learn about and practice working with a variety of tools like the command line, git, github, python, anaconda, and jupyter lab, and (b) helping students develop practical skills for managing data science workflows, finding help online (there's more to it than you might think!), and writing code in a manner that minimizes the likelihood of making mistakes, and maximizes the likelihood that when mistakes occur, they will be caught.
