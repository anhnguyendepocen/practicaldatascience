This means that (a) doing things incorrectly may lead to your computer crashing (So save all your open files before you start!), and (b) many of the commands you are being asked run will take several minutes each. \n",

However, to strike a balance between size and speed, we'll be working with a slightly thinned version that has only the last two years of data, instead of all six."
