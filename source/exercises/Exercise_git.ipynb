    "## Part 4: Dealing with Conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've completed your first full github workflow cycle! \n",
    "\n",
    "But truthfully, this was a *very* easy cycle. In reality, there are a few problems that often crop up, so let's explore what those look like now. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most common problem we face occurs when the repository you're working on changes *while you're working on your separate branch* in a way that causes conflicts. \n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, consider the following situation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You clone a repository, create a branch, and start making some edits to the code that reshapes the WDI data. For example, maybe you decide you want to use GDP per capita in constant 2010 dollars instead of current US dollars.  \n",
    "- While you are making these edits, someone else comes along and modifies the code that reshapes the WDI data too. For example, suppose they decide they want data from 2015 instead of 2016. \n",
    "- The *other* person's code gets merged into the master branch while you're still working on your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now the master branch and the branch you are working on have \"diverged.\" That's because changes to the master branch don't get immediately applied to other branches, so the master branch now reflects changes that aren't present on the branch you've been working on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, *if* the specific lines of code that define what variables to use and what year to use are different lines of code, then when you go to merge your edits into the master branch (after your PR has been reviewed), then you won't have any problems. **Github considers each line of code to be a separate entity,** and so it will only compare lines of code you've modified to those in the master branch, and will just apply *only* those changes when you merge your PR. So no conflict!  \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, this is what happened above -- while you were working on your PR, the master branch you were working off changed when you directly edited your README file. But that didn't cause a problem for git, because it could merge in your PR by just combining (a) the changes made to README since you created your branch, and (b) the changes you've made to your data analysis file since you created your branch to create a new commit on the master branch. Those changes were made to fully independent lines of code, so they didn't conflict. \n",
    "\n",
    "**But if changes are applied to the master branch that affect the same lines of code being modified on a different branch, then you get a conflict.** For example, if the lines of code that select the year to use are the same lines of code that selects the variables to keep, then github is stuck. It knows that *since the creation of your new branch* that same line of code was edited in both your file *and* in the master branch, and it doesn't know which one is correct. If it uses your version of that line of code, then it would delete those changes to use 2015 instead of 2016; but if it uses the code on the master branch, your changes to what variables you use will be ignored. \n",
    "\n",
    "So when it happens, github throws up its hands and says \"sorry, this is above my paygrade. There's a problem here I can't solve, so I need you to do it manually\". And that's what's called a merge conflict. \n",

And when you push a jupyter notebook, that notebook gets put into a queue for rendering, and it will thus only be visible as a rendered document when it gets to the front and gets rendered. This can take a while, so we'll just move on. But if you want to see what github looks like when presented a *rendered* notebook, you can find this page as a [github-rendered notebook here!](https://github.com/nickeubank/practicaldatascience/blob/master/source/exercises/Exercise_git.ipynb). \n",

    "This happens because the pretty version of the jupyter notebook you know and love is a *rendered* interface. If you want to see what a jupyter notebook looks like behind the scenes, click the *raw* button on the notebooks github page. *That* is actually everything that is in a jupyter notebook -- a plaintext file in JSON formatting. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is important to understand, because it also impacts how git manages changes to jupyter notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "**(9)** To illustrate, open the jupyter notebook you added to your repository and make some changes -- add some text in one cell, and maybe add a new cell. Then commit and push those changes. \n",

If you go to `Settings` for your github account, and look at `Billing`, you will see a \"Git LFS Data\" quota. So don't just go crazy. Compressed data files (e.g. HDF5 with compression) are your friend!\n",
    "    - LFS quotas accounting is based on the owner of the repository being used. If you push data (using LFS) to a repository owned by, say, me (nickeubank), then that data comes out of *my* quota, not yours. "
