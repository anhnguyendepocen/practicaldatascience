    "One of the defining features of `pandas` is the use of indices for data alignment. Like many features in `pandas`, it can make live very easy, but if you aren't careful, it can also lead to problems. This is especially true because indices lead to behavior that is very different from what one sees in other languages and library (like `R`, `numpy`, and `julia`). So let's spend a little timing practicing interacting with indices (and missing values)!"

So you can't just use `min()` or `max()`. We'll discuss converting string variables into numbers in a future class."
