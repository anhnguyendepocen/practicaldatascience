    "# Estimating Labor Market Returns to Education\n",

    "**Note:** Most students taking this class are Duke MIDS students who have worked with `pandas` previously. As a result, these exercises are very light on basic pandas Series and DataFrame manipulations. If you are new to `pandas`, I would advise looking into some addition practice opportunities with `pandas`, as discussed in the [Advice for Non-MIDS Students](../not_a_mids_student.ipynb) page. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we're going to use data from the [American Communities Survey (ACS)](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/acs.shtml) to study the relationship betwen educational attainment and wages. The ACS is a survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau (though it is not \"The Census\", which is a counting of every person in the United States that takes place every 10 years) to measure numerous features of the US population. The data we will be working with includes about 100 variables from the 2017 ACS survey, and is composed of only 10% of all the people actually surveyed by the ACS. This data comes from [IPUMS](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/), which provides a very useful tool for getting subsets of major survey datasets, not just from the US, but [from government statistical agencies the world over](https://international.ipums.org/international-action/sample_details).\n",

    "This is *real* data, meaning that you are being provided the data as it is provided by IPUMS. \n",
    "\n",
    "Within this data is information on both the educational background and current earnings of a representative sample of Americans. We will now use this data to estimate the labor-market returns to graduating high school and college, and to learn something about the meaning of an educational degree. "

Instead, this suggests employees pay high school graduates more because they think *the kind of people* who can finish high school are the *kind of people* who are likely to succeed. Finishing high school, in other words, isn't about accumulating specific knowledge; it's about showing that you *are the kind of person* who can rise to the challenge of finishing high school, also suggesting you are also the kind of person who can succeed as an employee. \n",
