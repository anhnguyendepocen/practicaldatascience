    "One of the defining features of `pandas` is the use of indices for data alignment. Like many features in `pandas`, it can make live very easy, but if you aren't careful, it can also lead to problems. This is especially true because indices lead to behavior that is very different from what one sees in other languages and library (like `R`, `numpy`, and `julia`). So let's spend a little timing practicing interacting with indices (and missing values)!"

    "Today, we will be using the ACS data we used during out first `pandas` exercise to examine the US income distribution, and how it varies by race. Note that because the US income distribution has a very small number of people with *extremely* high incomes, and the ACS is just a sample of Americans, the far right tail of the distribution will not be very well estimated. However, this data should suffice for helping to understand wealth inequality in the United States. \n",
