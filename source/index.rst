Welcome to Computer Science for Data Science!
=============================================

Data Science is an intrinsically applied discipline, and a modern Data Scientist must be familiar not only with the models they use, but also the computer they are using to do their work. With that in mind, this resource is designed to accomplish two things:

- Provide introductions to many of the computational tools *other than R, Python, or Julia* that are critical to being effective in the modern data science ecosystem, and
- Provide users with an introduction to Computer Science concepts that will make readers better Data Scientists in a concise, efficient manner.

This site is meant to be an *intermediate* data science resource, meaning that it assumes that the reader is already comfortable doing basic data manipulations (e.g. loading CSVs, tabulating data, merging data) in a language like R, Python, or Julia. Instead, this site is meant to provide readers with a place to come learn about all skills and concepts that people normally have to just pickup through (often painful) trial and error on the job, or by completing a computer science program (that does teach the material included here, but is not *designed* to teach the material here because computer science program are still designed to train either researchers or software developers).

In particular, this site provides tutorials on:

(Eventually the TOC below will be:)

Data Science Tools and Skills
-----------------------------

- **The Command Line:** that scary black text interface people are always using in movies to look intimidating (don't worry -- turns out it's not scary at all.)
- **Git and Github:** The tools used around the world to collaborate on code and share software
- **Getting Help Online:** There's more skill to this than you might think...

Computer Science for Data Science
---------------------------------

- **Defensive Programming:** How to write code that minimizes the likelihood you'll make mistakes and maximizes the likelihood that when you do make mistakes, you'll be able to catch them.
- **How computers think about numbers and text:** learn why 42.0 doesn't always equal 42.0.
- **Parallelization:** What is parallel computing, why is it becoming more and more important, and what are it's limitations
- **Big Data and The Memory Hierarchy:** Why working with big data requires categorically different strategies than smaller datasets.
- **Speed:** Why are some programming languages fast and others slow, how do I write code that runs quickly, and how to I evaluate the speed of my code?
