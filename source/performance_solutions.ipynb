Within this analysis we'll place several functions, most of which are fast, but one of which is slow. To make it *really* easy to see what is fast and what is slow, these functions will just call the `time.sleep()` function, which literally just tells the computer to pause for a given number of seconds (i.e. `time.sleep(10)` makes execution pause for 10 seconds).
